# ReFi Infra DAO: Empowering Communities Through Infrastructure 💡🏗️

ReFi Infra DAO is a groundbreaking platform that enables community members to collectively fund, build, and operate public infrastructure projects through decentralized governance. The core functionality of this project is powered by **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology**, ensuring that sensitive operations and data remain confidential throughout the process.

## Tackling Infrastructure Challenges

Infrastructure development has often been stifled by bureaucratic inefficiencies and a lack of community involvement. Traditional funding methods can overlook the wants and needs of local communities, resulting in projects that do not serve their intended purpose effectively. ReFi Infra DAO addresses this pain point by providing a platform for community-driven funding and decision-making, allowing members to contribute to and oversee projects that enhance their local environment.

## Harnessing FHE for Privacy and Governance

At the heart of ReFi Infra DAO is the implementation of Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) libraries. This cutting-edge technology allows the secure processing of encrypted data, meaning that community votes and operational metrics for decentralized infrastructure projects can be evaluated without compromising individual privacy. Utilizing open-source libraries like **Concrete** and the **zama-fhe SDK**, we ensure that community members can engage in governance and funding decisions transparently while maintaining confidentiality. 

### Here’s how FHE transforms our platform:

- **Privacy Governance**: Members vote to guide project funding and development without revealing their identity or intentions.
- **Data Security**: All operational data regarding infrastructure projects is encrypted, safeguarding against unauthorized access.
- **Decentralized Decision-Making**: Community members can confidently collaborate, knowing their contributions and votes are securely processed.

## Core Features 🌟

- **Community Governance**: Users participate in a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) model, allowing them to vote on project proposals and funding allocation through privacy-preserving mechanisms.
- **Funding Mechanism**: Harness DeFi principles to allow members to invest in infrastructure projects, with profits distributed fairly through the DAO.
- **Transparency and Progress Tracking**: Keep community members informed about project advancements and financial health through secure data sharing.
- **Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN)**: Build and manage community resources, such as local WiFi networks, by leveraging collective funding.

## Technology Stack 🛠️

- **Zama SDK**: The foundation of our confidential computing architecture, employing FHE for data privacy.
- **Node.js**: A powerful runtime for building scalable network applications.
- **Hardhat/Foundry**: Essential tools for Ethereum contract development, testing, and deployment.
- **Solidity**: The primary programming language for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Directory Structure 📁

Here’s how our project structure looks:

```

```

## Installation Guide 🔧

To set up the ReFi Infra DAO project, please follow the steps below:

1. Ensure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system.
2. Install Hardhat or Foundry, depending on your preference for Ethereum development tooling.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This will fetch the required Zama FHE libraries along with other necessary packages.

**Note**: Please avoid using `git clone` or any URLs. This process prioritizes a clean and error-free installation.

## Build & Run Guide 🚀

After setting up the project, you can compile, test, and run the application using the following commands:

1. **Compile the smart contracts**:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. **Run tests to ensure everything works as expected**:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. **Deploy the application to the Ethereum network**:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network_name>
   ```

   Replace `<network_name>` with the specific network you are targeting, such as Rinkeby or Mainnet.

### Example of Using Zama FHE in the Application

Here’s a code snippet demonstrating how we implement a basic voting function within the DAO:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract ReFi_Infra_DAO {
    mapping(bytes32 => uint256) public votes;

    function castVote(bytes32 proposalHash) external {
        // Securely process the vote using Zama's FHE mechanism
        votes[proposalHash]++;
    }

    function getVotes(bytes32 proposalHash) external view returns (uint256) {
        return votes[proposalHash];
    }
}
```

In this snippet, we are utilizing FHE to securely count votes for community proposals without exposing individual voter identities.

## Acknowledgements 🙏

This project is made possible thanks to the pioneering work of the Zama team, whose advancements in Fully Homomorphic Encryption and dedication to open-source innovation empower confidential blockchain applications. Our gratitude extends to the community and developers who contribute to making decentralized governance a reality.
